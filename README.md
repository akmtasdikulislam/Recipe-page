## My process

- At first, I linked the `style.css` & `Google Fonts CDN` with the `index.html`

- Secondly, I set the `CSS color variables` and base _font-size_ for this project into the `:root` of the _CSS Document_ which were given in the `style-guide.md`.

- Thirdly, I initialzed the _CSS Document_.

- Then, I wrote necessary code to structure the given UI Design Sample thorugh `HTML`
- Then, I wrote necessary css codes to match as close as possible with the _UI Design Sample_

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

By doing this project, I learned the following solutions,

- How to modify list item marker?

```css
/* --- UNORDERED LIST --- */
/* By using ::before pseudo element */
ul li::before {
  content: "\2022"; /* Inserting a circle bullet (‚Ä¢) using css code */
  font-size: 1.25em; /* Increasing its font-size */
  margin-right: 1.5em; /* Adding some intend to right */
}

/* --- ORDERED LIST --- */
ol {
  /* At first we are assinig a counter to parent element which will count all the list item in it */
  counter-reset: item;
  /* Removing default listing marker */
  list-style: none;
}

ol li {
  /* Then linking the parent counter with its child list items */
  counter-increment: item;
  /* Applying css flexbox to vertically align the marker and list text to center */
  display: flex;
  align-items: flex-start;
}

ol li::before {
  /* Here using ::before - css pseudo element to set new list marker. As it is a orderded list, it is assigning the current list item sequence position number. I'm also adding an extra dot (.) with it by putting within quotation mark */
  content: counter(item) ".";
  /* Styling the marker */
  color: var(--nutmeg);
  font-weight: 700;
  margin-right: 1.25em;
  text-align: center;
}
```

- How to align next line with the previous line of a paragraph after a line break

```css
ol li p {
  /* Here adding a padding left so that it have some space to left on every new line */
  padding-left: 1em;
  /* Then aligning the paragraph to left */
  text-align: left;
  /* Removing text indent so that the new line don't have any extra space on its before accept the padding left we specified earlier */
  text-indent: 0em;
}
```
